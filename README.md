## 🗺️ Downscaled Climate & Weather Data

The downscaled dataset used in this project was developed through a **collaboration between LEAP and NVIDIA**.

Using **AI-based diffusion methods**, large-scale climate and weather variables were transformed into **finer spatial resolutions**, enabling more localized analysis across New York City. These techniques allow high-level atmospheric information to be translated into neighborhood-scale signals suitable for urban risk assessment and resilience planning.

📓 For data access and usage guidance, please refer to:

- **`hackathon-2026.ipynb`** — Downscaled data access and exploration guide

> *Note:* Full methodological documentation is forthcoming and will be updated as additional details become available.

## 🤖 AI Resilience Agent — *The Resilience Agent*

🔗 **Live application:**  
http://nyc-resilience-eb.eba-3cjq6jn9.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/

The **Resilience Agent** is an AI-powered system designed to support climate resilience decision-making in New York City by translating complex, multi-source risk data into actionable insight.

### What it is
- 🧭 **A decision-support system** for resilience planning  
- 📊 **A risk interpretation tool** for multi-layered hazard data  
- 🧠 **An AI-assisted analyst** that explains, searches, and contextualizes risk  
- 🌉 **A bridge between technical data and real-world action**

### What it combines
- 🏛️ **Federal risk data** (FEMA National Risk Index)  
- 🗽 **Local NYC sensor intelligence**  
- 🗣️ **Community-reported signals and observations**  
- 🔍 **AI-driven explanation, synthesis, and search**

Together, these components enable users to explore **where risks exist, why they matter, and how they manifest on the ground**, supporting more informed, transparent, and equitable resilience decisions.
